# CP1404 Practicals

## Details

This folder contains the practical work I've completed for CP1404 at James Cook University (TR3 2023, TSV internal)


I'm currently doing a Bachelor of Marine Science (with a focus on marine physics) and am taking this subject as an
elective.

## Clean code lessons

Some of the main lessons I've learned about clean code are:

- GitHub and git are really useful (and not as intimidating as they seemed at first)
- main program structure (and not to use global variables!)
- recognising when to follow which programming patterns ("selecting the right tool for the job")
