# Reflection

## Estimates

The time estimates started really far off (mostly way over the actual time), but as I got less worried about
underestimating tasks, the accuracy seemed to improve (definitely underestimated some exercises though). (I also forgot
the time estimates a lot of the time, so this isn't based on much data.)

## Code Reviews

I really enjoyed seeing how other students interpreted the exercises and what solutions they came up with. Doing reviews
also helped me notice things I missed in my own code.
Spending ages on reviews has been an issue in many of my subjects, so this was also a good opportunity to work on not
doing that. (The first code review took me longer than the actual practical that week, but I think it's improved!)

Similarly, it was cool to see what people noticed reading my code and their reviews helped highlight details I'd
overlooked (or affirm decisions I wasn't as confident about before).

Here are two examples of the reviews I've done:
- [Practical 6](https://github.com/ctown0711/cp1404practicals/pull/3#event-10808702797)
- [Practical 9](https://github.com/E-Hunter1632/cp1404practicals/pull/6#event-11042038426)

## Practical tasks

Honestly, I'm not sure what I would change. If I were a teacher, I might've asked students to write an 
exercise (perhaps using xyz concepts/ patterns), though that could be difficult to mark (and I'm quite relieved that we 
didn't have to do that (despite how useful it might be)).
